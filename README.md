# React Vite Third-Party Libraries Boilerplate

Welcome to the React Vite `Third-Party Libraries Boilerplate`!

This boilerplate is designed to kickstart your React projects, providing a solid foundation with some of the most popular third-party libraries integrated for a smooth development experience.

## Demo

[You can check out a Demo of this boilerplate here.](https://technigo-third-partylibs-boiler-plate.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3.  Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

## Navigating the Repository

### üé® Styled Components

Navigate through the `src/commponents/styledComponents` directory to find component examples using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) library for styles. Styled Components allows you to use actual CSS syntax inside your components, ensuring a seamless styling experience within your React application.

### üé• Lottie Animations

Explore the `src/commponents/Lottie` directory to find pre-configured [Lottie Animations](https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/). We have left you 2 examples that you can base the implementation of the `lottie-react` library with simple and advanced use cases for controlling your animations.

[lottie-react](https://lottiereact.com/) is a great library that allows you to take more control over your animations.

### üåê React-i18next

The `src/commponents/Internationalization` directory contains configurations for [React-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/), a powerful internationalization framework for React / React Native which provides a way to format strings, dates, and numbers according to the user's locale, and translating your application to multiple languages.

You can also find a file under the name `i18n.js` which contains the implementation of an object called `resources` containing the translations used in the app.

### üìÖ Moment.js

The `src/commponents/Moment` directory contains configurations to utilize [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript. Check out the `src/utils` directory for utility functions that might use Moment.js for date manipulations.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

Here's a high-level overview of the relevant directories in this boilerplate:

- `src/assets/animations`: Lottie animations and related configurations.
- `src/i18n.js`: Internationalization configurations using React-i18next.

---

Tip: Before you decide to delete all components and start from scratch, we suggest examining them closely to grasp their structure. They can act as a blueprint for your future work.

We hope this guide helps you navigate and make the most out of this boilerplate.

Happy coding, Technigo students!
