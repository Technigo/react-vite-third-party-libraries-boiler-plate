# React Vite Third-Party Libraries Boilerplate

Welcome to the React Vite `Third-Party Libraries Boilerplate`!

This boilerplate is designed to kickstart your React projects, providing a solid foundation with some of the most popular third-party libraries integrated for a smooth development experience.

## Demo

[You can check out a Demo of this boilerplate here.](https://technigo-third-partylibs-boiler-plate.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3.  Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

## Navigating the Repository

### üé® Styled Components

Navigate through the `src/commponents/styledComponents` directory to find component examples using styled-components library for styles. Styled Components allows you to use actual CSS syntax inside your components, ensuring a seamless styling experience within your React application.

### üé• Lottie Animations

Explore the `src/animations` directory to find pre-configured [Lottie Animations](https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/). Lottie is a library that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as json and builds them natively on mobile and on the web!

### üåê React-i18next

The `src/locales` directory contains configurations for [React-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/), a powerful internationalization framework for React / React Native which provides a way to format strings, dates, and numbers according to the user's locale, and translating your application to multiple languages.

### üìÖ Moment.js

Utilize [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript. Check out the `src/utils` directory for utility functions that might use Moment.js for date manipulations.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

Here's a high-level overview of the relevant directories in this boilerplate:

- `src/styles`: Global styles and Styled Components configurations.
- `src/animations`: Lottie animations and related configurations.
- `src/locales`: Internationalization configurations using React-i18next.
- `src/utils`: Utility functions, possibly including date/time manipulations using Moment.js.

---

Tip: Before you decide to delete all components and start from scratch, we suggest examining them closely to grasp their structure. They can act as a blueprint for your future work.

We hope this guide helps you navigate and make the most out of this boilerplate.

Happy coding, Technigo students!
